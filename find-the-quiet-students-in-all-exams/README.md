<p>A "quite" student is the one who took at least one exam and didn't score neither the high score nor the low score.</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to report the students (student_id, student_name) being "quiet" in <strong>ALL</strong> exams.</p>

<p>Don't return the student who has never taken any exam. Return the result table <strong>ordered</strong> by student_id.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>Student table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 2           | Jade          |
+-------------+---------------+

For exam 1: Student 1 and 3 hold the lowest and high score respectively.
For exam 2: Student 1 hold both highest and lowest score.
For exam 3 and 4: Studnet 1 and 4 hold the lowest and high score respectively.
Student 2 and 5 have never got the highest or lowest in any of the exam.
Since student 5 is not taking any exam, he is excluded from the result.
So, we only return the information of Student 2.</pre>
